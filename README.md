# Reddit-Offline-Imager
Given a hard coded list of subreddit names, this program will use praw, selenium, and phantom.js to screenshot the top 25 subreddit submissions to view later.


(7/2/15)
At This time I have not ran or tested this program. It is built off of Reddit_Scrapper which works, but gets a screenshot using selenium and phantom.js versus urllib to get the data.
At the moment alot of subreddits which I want to test on are protesting reddit so I have not been able to run or test to find bugs in this program. This is why it is version 0.0.1. Once the subreddits are back I will test this to make sure it works.
