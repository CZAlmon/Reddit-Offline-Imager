# Reddit-Offline-Imager
Given a hard coded list of subreddit names, this program will use praw, selenium, and phantom.js to screenshot the top 25 subreddit submissions to view later.


This version works 100%. I have not encountered any bugs as of yet. This file will download screenshots of each subreddit submission. 

One thing about this is if the submission is flagged as 'NSFW' then a page warning you of this fact will be screenshot instead of the submission webpage.
